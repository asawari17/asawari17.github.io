<p> Hello! I am a fourth year PhD candidate in chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the <a href="https://zhiyuelu.wixsite.com/unc-lu-group">Lu group</a>.
I am interested in uncovering the role of temporal dynamics behind allosteric signal transduction in ligand-receptor sensors. 
These cell surface proteins are important drug targets and understanding their role in sensing paves a way to better understand the mechanism of drug action 
and efficacy. My research has involved modeling and simulations to study these systems. I have also done courses that have helped me develop skills in the general area of computer aided drug discovery
(CADD) as well as machine learning with graphs, I am passionate to pursue a career in quantitative systems pharmacology research and contribute in better and quicker medicines to human kind.
The projects I have worked on so far have been directed towards uncovering the limits of information content in the stochastic trajectories of sensors -- these results 
could help understand disease biology as well as protein functions better.
</p>

<p>Under this general topic, I have worked on multiple projects that have focused on: (1) Mutliplexing in biological receptors, 
(2) General theory of distinguishability of Markovian trajectories and (3) Transient performance -- withdrawal effect in sensors under concentration change
in environment.
</p>

<p>Previously, as an undergrad I worked on various research projects in theoretical and computational chemistry as a summer intern as well as for my bachelor's and master's theses with the <a href="https://ipc.iisc.ac.in/~bjc/">Cherayil group</a> 
 and the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/people/faculty-directory/core.host.html/content/shared/engineering/chemical-biological/profiles/faculty/errington-jeffrey-r.detail.html">Errington group</a> at the Indian Institue of Science, Bangalore and SUNY Buffalo respectively. 
 You can find more details about my research in my <a href="https://asawari17.github.io/publications/">published papers</a>.</p>

<p>Teaching has also been an intergral part of my PhD journey and I have taught multiple chemistry lab courses.</p>
