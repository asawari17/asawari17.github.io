<p> Hello! I am a third year PhD candidate in physical chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
My research focuses on understanding the physics of information transduction via biological sensors that perceive a cell's environment and
transmit the information to its interior leading to decisions that are essential for the cell's survival. These "molecular machines" transmit
 the environmental information by undergoing configurational changes that stimulate downstream reations. Since these sensors form a bottleneck 
 between the environment and the cells interior, the temporal trajectories of their configurationational states contains all the necessary 
 information about the environment. The projects I have worked on so far have been directed towards uncovering the limits of information 
 content in the stochastic trajectories of sensors.
</p>

<p>Under this general topic, I have worked on multiple projects that have focused on: (1) Mutliplexing in biological receptors, 
(2) General theory of distinguishability of Markovian trajectories and (3) Transient performance of sensors under concentration change
in environment. </p>
