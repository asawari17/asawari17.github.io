<p> Hello! I am a third year PhD candidate in physical chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
My research focuses on understanding the physics of information transduction via biological sensors that perceive a cell's environment and
transmit the information to its interior leading to decisions that are essential for the cell's survival. </p>
