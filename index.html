<p> Hello! I am a third year PhD candidate in chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the <a href="https://zhiyuelu.wixsite.com/unc-lu-group">Lu group</a>.
My research focuses on uncovering the physics of information transduction via biological sensors that perceive a cell's environment and
transmit the information to its interior leading to decisions that are essential for the cell's survival. These "molecular machines" transmit
 the environmental information by undergoing configurational changes that stimulate downstream reactions. Since these sensors form a bottleneck 
 between the environment and the cells interior, the temporal trajectories of their configurational states contains all the necessary 
 information about the environment. The projects I have worked on so far have been directed towards uncovering the limits of information 
 content in the stochastic trajectories of sensors.
</p>

<p>Under this general topic, I have worked on multiple projects that have focused on: (1) Mutliplexing in biological receptors, 
(2) General theory of distinguishability of Markovian trajectories and (3) Transient performance -- withdrawal effect in sensors under concentration change
in environment.
</p>

<p>Previously, as an undergrad I worked on various research projects in theoretical and computational chemistry as a summer intern as well as for my bachelor's and master's theses with the <a href="https://ipc.iisc.ac.in/~bjc/">Cherayil group</a> 
 and the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/people/faculty-directory/core.host.html/content/shared/engineering/chemical-biological/profiles/faculty/errington-jeffrey-r.detail.html">Errington group</a> at the SUNY Buffalo. 
 You can find more details about my research in my <a href="https://asawari17.github.io/publications/">published papers</a>.</p>

<p>Teaching has also been an intergral part of my PhD journey and I have taught multiple chemistry lab courses.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy solving puzzles, traveling, cooking and looking after my plants!</p>
